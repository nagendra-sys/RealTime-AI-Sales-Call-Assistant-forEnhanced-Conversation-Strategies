Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data, including noise and random fluctuations, making it perform well on the training set but poorly on new, unseen data.

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple or not complex enough to capture the important patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and test data.



1) True or False: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, including noise. This can lead to poor generalization on new, unseen data.
a. False
b. True

Correct! - b


2) True or False: Validation curves help in determining the best hyperparameters for a model by plotting the training and testing error against different values of the hyperparameter.
a. False
b. True

Correct! - b

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is given input data without any corresponding target labels. The goal is for the model to identify hidden patterns, relationships, or structures within the data on its own.
For example, when launching a new product, unsupervised learning can help identify customer segments based on purchasing behavior, even without prior knowledge of who the target customers are.

The main tasks in unsupervised learning are:
1. Clustering: Grouping similar data points together based on patterns or features (e.g., customer segmentation).
2. Association rules: Discovering relationships between variables in large datasets (e.g., products often bought together).
3. Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of features in the dataset while preserving its essential patterns (e.g., simplifying data for better visualization or processing).


Clustering in unsupervised learning is about identifying natural groups or patterns in data without prior labels, making it useful for discovering insights and understanding the structure of data. Here are some popular clustering algorithms:
- > K-Means Clustering: This algorithm divides data into 'K' clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster. It is simple and efficient but requires choosing the number of clusters (K) in advance.
- > Hierarchical Clustering: This method builds clusters in a tree-like structure called a dendrogram. It can either agglomerate (merge small clusters into larger ones) or divide (split large clusters into smaller ones), offering a flexible approach to identifying clusters at different levels of granularity.
- > DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN identifies clusters based on the density of data points. It groups together points that are closely packed while considering sparse points as noise. This method does not require specifying the number of clusters and can handle clusters of various shapes.
These algorithms help in various applications, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern discovery in large datasets.


Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in high-dimensional data, making it easier to analyze and visualize. It helps avoid issues like the *curse of dimensionality* (where data becomes sparse and harder to analyze as dimensions increase) and improves computational efficiency.
Two common methods are:
1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensions by finding new axes that capture the most variance in the data.
2. t-SNE: Projects high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D for easier visualization, grouping similar points together. 
These techniques simplify data analysis and visualization, especially in large datasets.


Association rules
Association rules are a data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships, patterns, or associations in large datasets. They are primarily applied in market basket analysis, where the goal is to find associations between items that are frequently purchased together. Association rules are often used in retail and e-commerce to optimize product recommendations, inventory management, and marketing strategies

3) You are a financial analyst at a bank and need to detect potentially fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. How could unsupervised learning be applied to identify unusual transaction patterns indicative of fraud?
a. Unsupervised learning can NOT be applied to detect fraudulent transactions.
b. Unsupervised learning can be applied to detect fraudulent transactions by training a supervised machine learning model on a labeled dataset of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
c. Unsupervised learning can be applied to detect fraudulent transactions by clustering normal and abnormal transaction patterns or using outlier detection methods to identify unusual transaction behavior.

Correct! - c

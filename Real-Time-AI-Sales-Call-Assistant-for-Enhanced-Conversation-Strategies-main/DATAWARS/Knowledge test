5) You are a healthcare researcher aiming to identify potential subgroups of patients based on their medical records to personalize treatment plans. How could unsupervised learning be utilized to uncover distinct patient clusters with similar medical profiles, allowing for more targeted and effective healthcare interventions?
a)	Unsupervised learning can classify patients into predefined categories based on their medical records.
b)	Unsupervised learning is not applicable in this scenario, and supervised learning should be used instead.
c)	Unsupervised learning can only be used if the dataset contains labeled patient groups.
d)	Unsupervised learning can segment patients into clusters based on their medical records, revealing distinct subgroups without using any predefined labels.
Correct! d

6) You are an e-commerce manager and want to predict whether customers are likely to make a purchase during their website visit. How can supervised learning be applied to develop a predictive model that helps classify customers into 'potential buyers' and 'non-buyers' based on historical data and labeled purchase information?
a)	Supervised learning can only be used if the purchase data is anonymized and doesn't contain labels.
b)	Supervised learning can be employed to classify customers into groups based on their purchase history and other features, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
c)	Supervised learning is not suitable for this scenario, and unsupervised learning should be used instead.
d)	Supervised learning requires an unsupervised learning pre-processing step to classify customers effectively.
